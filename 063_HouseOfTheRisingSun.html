[Verse 1] 
    [Am]   [C]        [D]          [F]
There is a house in New Orleans,
      [Am]       [C]      [E]
They call the "Rising Sun",
     [Am]       [C]       [D]           [F]
It's been the ruin of many a poor boy,
    [Am]     [E]         | Am | C | D | F | Am | E | Am | E | 
And God, I know, I'm one                (organ plays E7)


[Verse 2]
   [Am]     [C]     [D]        [F]
My mother was a tailor (organ: F7) 
    [Am]       [C]        [E]
She sewed my new blue jeans (organ: E7) 
    [Am]    [C]     [D]        [F]
My father was a gambling man,
[Am]      [E]     | Am | C | D | F | Am | E | Am | E | 
Down in New Orleans.             (organ plays E7)


[Verse 3]
        [Am]   [C]       [D]       [F]
Now the only thing a gambler needs (organ: F7) 
     [Am]       [C]     [E]
Is a suitcase and a trunk (organ: E7) 
        [Am]   [C]     [D]         [F]
And the only time, he's satisfied, 
   [Am]        [E]    | Am | C | D | F | Am | E | Am | E | 
Is when he's on a drunk              (organ plays E7)



[Verse 4]
   [Am]     [C]          [D]           [F]
O, mother, tell your children (organ: F7) 
       [Am]      [C]      [E] 
Not to do what I have done (organ: E7) 
[Am]         [C]        [D]           [F]
Spend your lives in sin and misery
       [Am]       [E]     | Am | C | D | F | Am | E | Am | E | 
In the House of Rising Sun              (organ plays E7)


[Verse 5]
                [Am]       [C]      [D]            [F]
Well, I've  got one foot on the platform (organ plays F7)
    [Am]         [C]      [E]
The other foot on the train (organ: E7) 
    [Am]    [C]       [D]     [F]
I'm going back to New Orleans (organ: F7) 
   [Am]        [E]         | Am | C | D | F | Am | E | Am | E | 
To wear that ball and chain              (organ plays E7#9)


[Verse 6]
            [Am]   [C]        [D]             [F]
Well, there is a house in New Orleans (organ: F7) 
     [Am]        [C]      [E]
They call the "Rising Sun"  (organ: E7) 
         [Am]       [C]       [D]           [F]
And it's been the ruin of many a poor boy
    [Am]     [E7]      | Am | C | D | F7 | Am | E7 |
And God, I know, I'm one
